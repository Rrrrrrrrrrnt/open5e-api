The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight when it or whatever it is trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.\\n\\nAt the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of exhaustion by one. If this reduces the level of exhaustion to zero, the creature is cured.\\n\\nA failed save increases its level of exhaustion by one and the disease intensifies. After one failed save, the creature has a strong desire to surround itself with as many creatures as possible. After two failed saves, the creature becomes more irritable and violent. If the infected creature has 4 levels of exhaustion (hit points halved), spines of fungus erupt from its body, killing it, and the fungus takes full control of the creature’s corpse. It gains the Explosive Death trait and Bite and Vomit Spores attacks from the afflicted cave goblin’s stat block.\"}]",
